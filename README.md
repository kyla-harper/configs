# Setting up a new machine
Here's a sketch of how I set up a new Manjaro i3 machine. To run the setup,
clone this repo into `~/Workspace/` and then run `install.sh`

This repo sets up a new Manjaro i3 machine. To start the install:
`wget -O - https://github.com/SansSeryph/configs | bash`

# To Dos
  * Logging
  * Postgres setup - grab username before creating role

# Post-Setup Reminders
  * Create a new SSH key and give it a password: `ssh-keygen`
    * Add this key to Github
