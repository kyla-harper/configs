# Info
This repo is place for me to store all of my configs and OS related stuff. Use at your own risk!

# Setting up a new machine
Here's a sketch of how I set up a new Manjaro i3 machine. To run the setup,
clone this repo into `~/Workspace/` and then run `install.sh`

# To Dos
  * Find a way to start the keybase service
  * Make it so the install script can run from anywhere
  * Set up links to config files instead of copying them
  * Logging

# Optional Items
  * Install Steam

# Post-Setup Reminders
* Keybase: Log in and add new device
* KeepassXC: Run the app and get to the point of opening the password file
* Create a new SSH key and give it a password: `ssh-keygen`
  * Add this key to Github and Gitlab accounts
* Discord: Start and log in
* Log into Firefox account
